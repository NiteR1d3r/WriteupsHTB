Heist Hack the Box

IP - 10.10.10.149

Like always we get going by scanning the box and seeing what is running
on each port. We see smb and other related ports for Windows RPC and we
also see a web port listening on port 80. Starting with that we head there
to see what is going on.

When first landing on the web port 80 we see a login page. Without spending much
time as seen in the bottom right corner to login as guest so that just got us in the
web app. Here on http://10.10.10.149/issues.php we can see one of the comments from
Hazard has an attachment so we click on that.

Found this file after logging in as the guest from the attachment on the page from 
Hazard. We can see different sets of hashes so we begin to crack each one with 2 of
the passwords being different than a normal Cisco password. It is an older type 7
password hash. This is no longer the standard and is not recommended to override the
default hashing scheme of Cisco.

These can be broken using https://www.ifm.net.nz/cookbooks/passwordcracker.html for the cisco 7 passwords
which was funny to see them again as when I first got on Cisco it was still viable to use it. 

After that we use impacket or tool of choice to scan for SID's from Windows and this is the user list
we come up with to place in our user.txt file. 

Users-

500: SUPPORTDESK\Administrator (SidTypeUser)
501: SUPPORTDESK\Guest (SidTypeUser)
503: SUPPORTDESK\DefaultAccount (SidTypeUser)
504: SUPPORTDESK\WDAGUtilityAccount (SidTypeUser)
513: SUPPORTDESK\None (SidTypeGroup)
1008: SUPPORTDESK\Hazard (SidTypeUser)
1009: SUPPORTDESK\support (SidTypeUser)
1012: SUPPORTDESK\Chase (SidTypeUser)
1013: SUPPORTDESK\Jason (SidTypeUser)

A while ago I altered evil-winrm.rb to cycle thru users and passes from our collected intel now.
After scanning thru we landed on Chase as our user.  

bash~# ruby evil-winrm.rb -i 10.10.10.149 -u chase -p 'Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d' -s /usr/opt -e /usr/opt

Logged in and got user.txt now off to root flag we go.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Chase\Desktop> more user.txt
a127daef77ab6d9*************

As you can see in the login.php file in C:\inetpub\wwwwroot\there is a hash and I am sure many failed to crack it as this password was very complex. So we now scrape around looking for a way to privlage esc
and start eumerating more.

Next by running ps we can see that there is a odd process on a server firefox so with a 
one liner we can use procdump.exe to extract some intel from it see what is in there.  

Then load procdump.exe

Commands to extract after loading procdump can do this from evil-winrm or get a meterpreter shell
and load procdump from there either way will work. 

Then from here for example - 

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Chase\Desktop> procdump.exe -ma -accepteula 6264

The number is the PID running and you will see it output a dmp file for us to dig in and see if anything we can find from firefox process. Next run a simple command to extract the kind of content we are looking for like password or login. 

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Chase\Desktop> get-content .*.dmp | select-string -pattern 'login'

This was in our dump file after running and more ofcouse just picked out the relevant line 
to demostrate.

localhost/login.php?login_username=admin@support.htb&login_password=4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ&login=

Now we should have our username and pass for root flag. We then login

administrator
4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> more root.txt
50dfa3c6bfd20e************

There we have it root flag and off we go....
